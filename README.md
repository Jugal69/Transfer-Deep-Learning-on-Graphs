# Transfer-Deep-Learning-on-Graphs
Performing Transfer Deep Learning on Graph Structured Data

1) Developed an approach for performing Transfer Learning on Text Data using CNN & graphs.
2) Used word2vec model to generate graphs from text data & applied kernel PCA for dimensionality reduction, along with CNN
procedure to perform classification on a different dataset belonging to the same domain.
3) Tools/Technologies Used: Python, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn.
